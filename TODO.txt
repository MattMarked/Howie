Additional frontends:
 - ICQ: I haven't found a Python ICQ module yet.
 - WEB: In progress.
 - IRC: There's definitely demand for it, but I'm not an IRC user myself, so
        I'm not sure what an IRC front-end would entail.  Volunteers are
        welcome!

Additional extension modules:
 - Email spoofer.
 - Address book / contact manager
 - Sysadmin assistant

Other features:
